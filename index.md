It was right then that I started thinking about Thomas Jefferson--<the Declaration of Independence> and the part about our right to life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I remember thinking. How did he know to put the “pursuit” part in there?That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it no matter what. How did he know that?
